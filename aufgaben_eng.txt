Exercises in experiment 6.8 (Supernova)
===================================
1. Discussion of the spectrum on days 2, 10 and 50
- changes (brightness, flow distribution, lines)
- find the continuum
- search abs./em. lines
- which lines are to be expected
- typical speeds Vabs

2. Determine R_abs
- for day 2,5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100
from measurement of lambda (Abs.max)
Calculate v (Abs.max) (Doppler effect)
Calculate R (Abs.max) (homologous expansion)

Discussion of the stratification found

3. Determine the photosphere radius

L for D = 50 kpc is known from Table 1.
For the tabulated days
- Adapt Planck curves.
- Determine maximum (continuum) and from this
  determine T (Wien's displacement law).

Discussion of the two methods for T

Determine photosphere radius from T (Stefan-Boltzmann law)

Determine distance D by comparing R (Abs.max) and R (Phot).

Assessment of energies as
EM energy, Kinetic energy, neutrino energy.

Discussion of the energies.
